##Raspberry Pi Ds18b20 Temperature Sensor logger with Sixfab Xbee Shield

Anywhere you can connect to another nodes simply. Connect Xbee shield to Raspberry Pi and use ds18b20 sensor to log temperature information.

1. Firstly, Connect your Raspberry Pi to internet and run `sudo apt-get update` to update your Raspberry Pi
2. We should stop getty service on Raspbian.
  1. For non Raspberry Pi 3 machines, remember it’s /dev/ttyAMA0 that is linked to the getty (console) service. So you need to perform this command from a terminal window:
    - `sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service`
    - `sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service`
  
  2. For Raspberry Pi 3’s the command is similar but referencing /dev/ttyS0:
    - `sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service`
    - `sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service`
    
  3. You also need to remove the console from the cmdline.txt. If you edit this with:
    - `sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt`<br/><br/>
      ```
      dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles
      ```<br/><br/>
      remove the line: console=serial0,115200 and save and reboot for changes to take effect.
  4. You also need to enable uart with edit /boot/config.txt file
    - `sudo nano /boot/config.txt` and add `enable_uart=1` to bottom of file then save and reboot for changes to take effect.
3. Edit `/boot/config.txt` file with nano by running `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`and add `dtoverlay=w1-gpio`, save and exit.
4. Edit `/etc/modules` file with nano by running `sudo nano /etc/modules`and add following text, save and exit.
  ```
    w1-gpio
    w1-therm
    
  ```
5. Download source code [Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sixfab/rpiShields/master/tutorials/tutorial6/XbeeTemp.py)
  - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sixfab/rpiShields/master/tutorials/tutorial6/XbeeTemp.py`

6. Make it executable
  - `sudo chmod +x XbeeTemp.py`
  
7. Run it
  - `sudo python XbeeTemp.py`
